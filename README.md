# Hi there, stranger! 👋
### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Eli Perchenok, and I am a senior Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate student with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Connecticut. My main focus is in systems and networks.

Skilled in both hardware and software, I have developed a solid background in background logic, testing, and database work. I also have hands-on experience in network design, as well as level 1/level 2 technical support.

I have a certification in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and am currently working on more.

I am interested in networks, databases, cloud engineering and everything in between.

I'm currently seeking full-time engineering and analyst opportunities in collaborative environments, and would love to work with you.
